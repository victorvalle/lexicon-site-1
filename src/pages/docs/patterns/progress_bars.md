## Usage

Progress bars can be classified in two groups:

**Indeterminate**: where there are no intermediate states. As long as the process is running the progress bar grows continuously from 0% to 100%. Use it for system processes.

**Determinate**: where there are intermediate states in the completion process. Used to show the user where is inside a process divided in steps. Use it for user processes.

## Sizes

Indeterminate progress bars can be configured in 4 differents sizes

| Size | Usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| Extra small | TODO: Where |
| Default | TODO: Where |
| Large | TODO: don't use it | 
| Extra Large | TODO: don't use it | 

## Variations

### Progress bar

This is an indeterminate progress bar. This progress bar can be used with or without label.
If you foresee this pattern will be used in a process that can take long time to be completed, a label can be useful to the user. But there is not always the need to show the completion percentage.

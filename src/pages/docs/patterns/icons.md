Icon is a visual metaphor representing a concept that lies behind the idea and/or action.


## Liferay icon library

### Other icon libraries

[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/) are good alternatives in case you don't want to use Lexicon icon library.

## Usage

Icons can be used only when the metaphor is direct and clear. In case there is not a good icon to represent the concept you want to transmit, it will probably better to use words. Icons must be reserved to broad accepted visual ideas.

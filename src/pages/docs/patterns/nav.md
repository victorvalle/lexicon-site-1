## Definition
Nav is the pattern that defines the vertical navigation pattern.

## Usage

A vertical navigation can be simple or it can be nested, where some of the entries could have interior levels of navigation.

In a nested navigation usually the first level opens the second. Levels that open interior levels must be always identified with a disclosure arrow that indicates this action.

It is possible to nest as many levels as you want in a nested navigation but we encourage to use a maximum of two nested levels.
